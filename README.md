# Apple-Picker-Game

Note: This was created freshman year of college, before learning key object-oriented design principles. I would go about this project quite differently now. It's still fun, though!

Goal: Get as high a score as possible by eating the apples.

Eventually "bad apples" will spawn that reset your score upon being eaten.

Red apples are worth 1 point.

Golden apples are quite rare, and are worth five points. They time out after 5 seconds, so be sure to eat them quickly! They also allow you to consume the bad apples for about 7 seconds. While under the effects of the golden apple, bad apples are worth 2 points.
