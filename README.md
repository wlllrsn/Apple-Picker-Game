# Apple-Picker-Game
A game I created over the last few days
Goal: Get as high a score as possible by eating the apples
Eventually, more and more "bad apples" will spawn that reset your score upon being eaten.
Red apples are worth 1 point
Golden apples are quite rare, and are worth five points. They time out after 5 seconds, so be sure to eat them quickly! They also allow you to consume the bad apples for about 7 seconds.
